  \paragraph{2. Lipschitz Continuity of Convex Functions}
  \begin{proof}
    First, we construct a compact subset $Z$ containing $X$. Put 
    \[
      Z=\{z:\,\|z-x\|\le 1\text{ for some $x\in \cl X$} \}.
    \]
    Since $X$ is bounded, $Z$ is also bounded. Let $(z_n)\subset Z$ be a 
    sequence converging to some point $z$. Let $(x_n)\subset\cl X$ be such that
    $\|x_n-z_n\|\le 1$. Since $\cl X$ is bounded, $(x_n)$ has a convergent 
    subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ converging to some point $x$. Since $\cl X$ is 
    closed, $x\in X$. By the continuity of the norm, we have
    \[
      1\ge\lim_{k\to\infty}\|x_{n_k}-z_{n_k}\|=\|x-z\|.
    \]
    Hence, $z\in Z$, implying that $Z$ is closed. Thus, $Z$ is compact.\par
    Now, we show that $f$ is Lipschitz continuous over $X$. Fix $x,y\in X$.
    Let $z=y+(y-x)/\|y-x\|$. Note that $z\in Z$ and
    \[
      y=\frac{\|y-x\|}{\|y-x\|+1}z+\frac{1}{\|y-x\|+1}x.
    \]
    Since $f$ is convex, we have
    \[
      f(y)=\frac{\|y-x\|}{\|y-x\|+1}f(z)+\frac{1}{\|y-x\|+1}f(x)
      \,\Rightarrow\,
      f(y)-f(x)\le\|y-x\| (f(z)-f(y)).
    \]
    By Prop. 1.4.6, $f$ is continuous. And since $Z$ is compact, $f$ can 
    attain its minimum and maximum on $Z$. Hence,
    \[
      f(y)-f(x) \le \|y-x\|\left(\max_{z\in Z}f(z)-\min_{z\in Z}f(z)\right)
      =L\|y-x\|.
    \]
    Interchange the roles of $x$ and $y$ and we get $|f(y)-f(x)|\le L\|y-x\|$.
    Namely, $f$ is Lipschitz continuous.
  \end{proof}
  
  \paragraph{3. Exact Penalty Functions}
  \begin{proof}
    $\,$\par
    (a) First, suppose $x^*$ minimizes $f$ over $X$. For every $x\in Y$, fix
    $\vep>0$. Let $z\in X$ be such that $\|z-x\|<\inf_{y\in X}\|y-x\|+\vep$.
    Then
    \begin{align*}
      F_c(x)+c\vep
      &=f(x)+c\left(\inf_{y\in X}\|y-x\|+\vep\right)\\
      &>f(x)+c\|z-x\|\\
      &\ge f(x)+\frac{c}{L}|f(z)-f(x)|\\
      &\ge f(x)+|f(z)-f(x)|\\
      &\ge f(z)\\
      &\ge f(x^*).
    \end{align*}
    Hence, $x^*$ also minimizes $F_c(x)$ over $Y$. \par
    (b) Note that for fixed $x$, to minimize $\|y-x\|$ over $X$, it suffices
    to minimize it over $X\cap B$ where $B$ is a closed ball centered at $x$
    and $X\cap B\ne\varnothing$. Since $X$ is closed and $B$ is compact; and
    $\|\cdot\|$ is continuous, the infimum can be attained.\par
    We argue by contradiction. Suppose that $x^*$ minimizes $F_c$ over $Y$
    and assume $x^*\notin\delta$. Since $X$ is closed, this implies that 
    $\min_{y\in X}\|y-x^*\|=\|y^*-x^*\|=\delta>0$. Hence, $f(y^*)\ne f(x^*)$ 
    and
    \begin{align*}
      F_c(x^*)
      &=f(x^*)+c\|y^*-x^*\|\\
      &\ge f(x^*)+\frac{c}{L}|f(y^*)-f(x^*)|\\
      &>f(x^*)+|f(y^*)-f(x^*)|\\
      &\ge f(y^*)\\
      &=F_c(y^*),
    \end{align*}
    which contradicts the assumption that $x^*$ minimizes $F_c$. Thus, $x^*
    \in X$ and, therefore, $x^*$ minimizes $f$ over $X$.
  \end{proof}
