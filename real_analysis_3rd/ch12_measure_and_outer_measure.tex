\section{Measure and Outer Measure}
\subsection{Outer Measure and Measurability}
  \paragraph{1.}
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose that $E\subset X$ and there is a measurable $B$ with $\bar{\mu}B=0$
    such that $E\subset B$. We show that $E$ is measurable, that is, for every
    $A\subset X$ with finite outer measure, $\mu^*(A)\ge\mu^*(A\cap E)+\mu^*(
    A\cap E^c)$. Since $A\cap E\subset E\subset B$ and $\mu^*$ is monotone,
    $\mu^*(A\cap E)\le\mu^*(B)=\bar{\mu}B=0$. Again by the monotonicity, $\mu^*(
    A)\ge\mu^*(A\cap E^c)$. Thus, $E$ is measurable, implying that $\bar{\mu}$
    is complete.
  \end{proof}

  \paragraph{2.}
  \begin{proof}
    From the countable subadditivity we obtain that $\mu^*(A\cap E)\le\sum\mu^*
    (A\cap E_i)$. For the converse, first we consider just $E_1$ and $E_2$. 
    Since $E_1$ is measurable,
    \[
      \mu^*(A\cap E)=\mu^*(A\cap E\cap E_1)+\mu^*(A\cap E\cap E_1^c)
      \ge\mu^*(A\cap E_1)+\mu^*(A\cap E_2).
    \]
    By induction on $n$ we get $\mu^*(A\cap E)\ge\sum_{i=1}^n\mu^*(A\cap E_i)$.
    Let $n\to\infty$ and the proof is completed.
  \end{proof}
